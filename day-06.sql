-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

WITH annual_snowfall as (
  SELECT resort_id, resort_name, SUM(snowfall_inches) as annual_snowfall
  FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
    GROUP BY resort_id, resort_name
),
  snow_buckets AS (
  SELECT *, NTILE(4) over(ORDER BY annual_snowfall) as bucket
  FROM annual_snowfall
)

SELECT * FROM snow_buckets;
